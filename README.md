# NeonateCare
An IOT based neonate monitoring system.

This system measures the temperature and humidity of the surroundings of a new born baby using the DHT11 sensors. Based on the data automatically swings the fan and cradle. Here we used ESP8266 wifi module and Thinkspeak cloud for connection between the arduino and app. 

This project was done by me and Fahad-2019331028 for our undergrad 2nd year course PROJECT 250.
